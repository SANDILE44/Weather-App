About the App

This Weather App was built by me, **Sandile Thabethe**, as a practical project to apply what I’ve learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to check the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any city they search or by using their current location.

The app connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data. It displays temperature, weather conditions, and icons representing the forecast — all with a clean and responsive design.

This is part of my journey into tech, as I study and grow my skills to become a professional developer. My goal is to build real-world projects, and this app is one of them. More improvements and features will be added as I continue learning.
